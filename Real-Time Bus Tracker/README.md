<h1>Real Time Bus Tracking</h1>

<h2>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>In this project, I showcase my use of <i><b>GeoJSON</b></i>, <i><b>Mapbox</b></i>, along with <i><b>JavaScript</i></b>, as a tool to view real time mapping data for stops along a bus route between MIT and Harvard in Boston, Massachusetts.</p>

<h2>HOW TO RUN THIS PROGRAM</h2>
<ul>
<li>Begin by cloning this repository into your local environment in GitHub</li>
<li>Navigate to https://account.mapbox.com/ and create a free account</li>
<li>Copy the provided public token (or you may opt to generate your own).</li>
<li>Open the mapanimation.js file and replace my token with the one you were provided (or generated) with MapBox.</li>
<li>Open your preferred internet browser (I used Chrome), and drag the index.html file into the browser to open the project.</li>
</ul>

<h3>ROADMAP OF PLANNED IMPROVEMENTS</h3>
<p>Permanant markers of existing bus stops to aid in stop selection. Time stamps of real-time stops for data accuracy and rider planning.</p>
