Real Time Bus Tracking

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
In this project, I showcase my use of GeoJSON, Mapbox, along with JavaScript, as a tool to view real time mapping data for stops along a bus route between MIT and Harvard in Boston, Massachusetts.

HOW TO RUN THIS PROGRAM

Begin by cloning this repository into your local environment in GitHub
Navigate to https://account.mapbox.com/ and create a free account
Copy the provided public token (or you may opt to generate your own).
Open the mapanimation.js file and replace my token with the one you were provided (or generated) with MapBox.
Open your preferred internet browser (I used Chrome), and drag the index.html file into the browser to open the project.


ROADMAP OF PLANNED IMPROVEMENTS
Permanant markers of existing bus stops to aid in stop selection. Time stamps of real-time stops for data accuracy and rider planning.
