PacMen Game

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
In this project, I showcase my use of array methods and DOM manipulation within coding to create a simple but dynamic game that allows players to add PacMen characters to their game box and trigger them to move randomly across the board with a click of a button.

HOW TO RUN THIS PROGRAM
Begin by cloning this repository into your local environment in GitHub.
Open your preferred internet browser (I used Chrome), and drag the index.html file into the browser to open the project.


ROADMAP OF PLANNED IMPROVEMENTS
Randomized color changes to each newly added PacMan character.
