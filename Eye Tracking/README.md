<h3>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h3>
  <p>In this project, I demonstrate style manipulatation within <b>CSS</b> and how it can create a really dynamic user interface when combined with <b>JavaScript</b> and <b>HTML</b> to create the effect in which it appears the pupils in a set of eyes are following along with the movement of the user's curser/mouse.

<ul>
  <li>Begin by cloning this repository into your local environment in GitHub</li>
  <li>Open your preferred internet browser (I used Chrome), and drag the index.html file into the browser to open the project.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
